// Cross platform socket behaviour.

//	Notes:
//		Use the wrapped calls here instead of raw socket calls wherever
//	possible as these calls abstract away the differences between the
//	platforms.
//
//		If you want to make a socket non-blocking, use MakeSocketNonBlocking()
//	as it is platform independent.
//
//		Use IsRecvPending() as a replacement for the use case of checking if
//	a single socket has pending data, rather than trying to use select()
//	directly as this is a common cause of subtle platform bugs.  If you need
//	to check multiple sockets simultaneously, then use select() as you
//  *ought* to know what you're doing!
